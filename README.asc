=== Recipes App
* *What I've learned*:
  ** Working in teams using Kanban/Scrum effectively;
  ** Use Redux to manage state;
  ** Using the React-Redux library;
  ** Use the React Context API to manage state;
  ** Use React Hook useState;
  ** Using React Hook useContext;
  ** Using React Hook useEffect;
  ** Create custom hooks;
  
* *Source code*:
  ** https://recipes-app-project.vercel.app/[Project Deployed]  
  ** https://github.com/tryber/sd-013-a-project-recipes-app/pull/783[Pull request from Trybe]
  
* *What is missing*:
  ** [ ]Design unit tests so that coverage is at least 90%;
  ** [ ]Implement the heart icon (favorite) so that it must be filled in if the recipe is favorited and "unfilled" otherwise;
  ** [ ]Implement the logic in the favorite button, if clicked, the heart icon must change its current state, if it is filled, it must change to "unfilled" and vice versa.
